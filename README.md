# Quart

Quart is an async Python web application framework. Using Quart you can,

- render and serve HTML templates,
- write (RESTful) JSON APIs,
- serve WebSockets,
- stream request and response data,
- do pretty much anything over the HTTP or WebSocket protocols.

## Quickstart

Install from PyPI using an installer such as pip.

```
$ pip install quart
```

Save the following as `app.py`. This shows off rendering a template, returning
JSON data, and using a WebSocket.

```python
from quart import Quart, render_template, websocket

app = Quart(__name__)

@app.route("/")
async def hello():
    return await render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/api")
async def json():
    return {"hello": "world"}

@app.websocket("/ws")
async def ws():
    while True:
        await websocket.send("hello")
        await websocket.send_json({"hello": "world"})
```

```
$ quart run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (CTRL + C to quit)
```

To deploy this app in a production setting see the [deployment] documentation.

## Relationship with Flask

Quart is an asyncio reimplementation of the popular [Flask] web application
framework. This means that if you understand Flask you understand Quart.

Like Flask, Quart has an ecosystem of extensions for more specific needs. In
addition, a number of the Flask extensions work with Quart.

### Migrating from Flask

It should be possible to migrate to Quart from Flask by a find and replace of
`flask` to `quart` and then adding `async` and `await` keywords. See the
[migration] documentation for more help.
