Quart is an async Python web microframework. Using Quart you can,

* render and serve HTML templates,
* write (RESTful) JSON APIs,
* serve WebSockets,
* stream request and response data,
* do pretty much anything over the HTTP or WebSocket protocols.

Quickstart
----------

Quart can be installed via `pip
<https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html>`_,

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install quart

and requires Python 3.7.0 or higher (see `python version support
<https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/discussion/python_versions.html>`_
for reasoning).

A minimal Quart example is,

.. code-block:: python

    from quart import Quart, render_template, websocket

    app = Quart(__name__)

    @app.route("/")
    async def hello():
        return await render_template("index.html")

    @app.route("/api")
    async def json():
        return {"hello": "world"}

    @app.websocket("/ws")
    async def ws():
        while True:
            await websocket.send("hello")
            await websocket.send_json({"hello": "world"})

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()

if the above is in a file called ``app.py`` it can be run as,

.. code-block:: console

    $ python app.py

To deploy this app in a production setting see the `deployment
<https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/tutorials/deployment.html>`_
documentation.

Contributing
------------

Quart is developed on `GitHub <https://github.com/pallets/quart>`_. If
you come across an issue, or have a feature request please open an
`issue <https://github.com/pallets/quart/issues>`_. If you want to
contribute a fix or the feature-implementation please do (typo fixes
welcome), by proposing a `merge request

Testing
^^^^^^^

The best way to test Quart is with `Tox
<https://tox.readthedocs.io>`_,

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install tox
    $ tox

this will check the code style and run the tests.

Help
----

The Quart `documentation <https://quart.palletsprojects.com>`_ or
`cheatsheet
<https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/reference/cheatsheet.html>`_
are the best places to start, after that try searching `stack overflow
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/quart>`_ or ask for help
`on discord <https://discord.gg/pallets>`_. If you still
can't find an answer please `open an issue
<https://github.com/pallets/quart/issues>`_.

Relationship with Flask
-----------------------

Quart is an asyncio reimplementation of the popular `Flask
<http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ microframework API. This means that if you
understand Flask you understand Quart.

Like Flask, Quart has an ecosystem of extensions for more specific
needs. In addition a number of the Flask extensions work with Quart.

Migrating from Flask
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It should be possible to migrate to Quart from Flask by a find and
replace of ``flask`` to ``quart`` and then adding ``async`` and
``await`` keywords. See the `docs
<https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/how_to_guides/flask_migration.html>`_
for more help.
